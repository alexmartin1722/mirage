The eruption featured outbreaks of high lava fountains, lava flows, and volcanic gas in the Leilani Estates subdivision, as well as earthquakes and ground deformation. 24 fissures erupted lava, including some near the Leilani Estates subdivision, forcing residents to evacuate. The lava damaged the Puna Geothermal Venture, buried part of Hawaii Route 137, and flowed into the ocean. On May 29, Lava from a northeastern flow also overran Hawaii Route 132, cutting off access between Kapoho and P\u0101hoa before reaching and filling Kapoho Crater and Kapoho Bay on June 4, forming a point where the Bay had been by June 5. The same flow also destroyed the subdivision of Vacationland Hawaii.

Irma was a Category 5 hurricane and the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Irma was also the strongest tropical cyclone by wind speed worldwide in 2017. Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its path, and was particularly severe in the northeastern Caribbean. \r\n\r\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands. Irma then became a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale before resuming intensifying on September 4 and becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early September 5. Irma's intensity peaked on September 6 with 1-minute sustained winds at 180mph and a minimum pressure of 914 hPa. Before making landfall in Cuba, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane, but regained its Category 5 status before hitting Cuba. \r\n\r\nIrma hit both Caribbean islands and the continental United States. Irma caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane. Irma also made landfall in Anguilla, Barbados, Cuba, French West Indies, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and the Dutch side of Sint Maarten. After crossing the Straits of Florida, Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key on September 10 making landfall in Florida before then making landfall at Marco Island. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "query_id":

It featured key issues around the tariffs and threats of annexation from the current United States president Donald Trump. \r\n\r\nThe Liberal Party won a fourth term in the election, forming a minority government. The NDP received just over six percent of the popular vote and only won seven seats in the election. As a result, the NDP lost official party status. Additionally, Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative Party leader, did not win re-election to his parliamentary seat. \r\n\r\nThere was a concentration of support for the two major parties, where initial polls, from mid-2023 to January 2025, indicated the Conservatives would win in a landslide. However, the Liberal party reversed these trends, with Carney's replacement of Justin Trudeau as leader playing a key role in the turnaround.

date he called 'Liberation Day.'  The Trump administration called the measures 'reciprocal' tariffs to mirror and counteract foreign trade barriers imposed on U.S. exports. The tariffs imposed a 10% baseline tariff and higher rates to countries which the United States had the largest trade deficits. With the tariffs, the Trump administration also closed the de minimis exemption for China.   \r\n\r\nThe announcement lead to a global market crash and was faced with criticism. Trade analysts rejected the Trump administrations characterization of tariffs as 'reciprocal,' noting that the tariffs often exceeded those imposed by trading partners and included countries with which the U.S. had a trade surplus. Economists also criticized the formula used to calculate the tariffs, calling it simplistic and based on flawed economic reasoning. \r\n\r\nThe executive order signed by Trump to implement these tariffs declared a national emergency over the United States' trade deficit and invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize sweeping tariffs on foreign imports. On May 28, 2025, the United States Court of International Trade ruled Trump had overstepped his authority in imposing tariffs under the IEEPA and ordered that the 'Liberation Day' tariffs be vacated. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a stay while it considered the administration's appeal, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect.", "query_id": "2025_query_2", "videos": {"zYiF24FJkTY": {"language": "english"}, "OtAFxwhze3Y": {"language": "english"}, "GtGmC-yrDMg": {"language": "english"}, "G9KD7XGIVTM": {"language": "english"}, "fmPZJBIQ7xc": {"language": "english"}, "FScf5NG-3MM": {"language": "english"}, "nQnJajI4Vjo": {"language": "english"}, "sQ4nSun5KBQ": {"language": "english"}, "_AWFQIjUMuI": {"language": "english"}, "S0C0crjCBvM": {"language": "english"}, "K61OTQazQwY": {"language": "english"}}}}
