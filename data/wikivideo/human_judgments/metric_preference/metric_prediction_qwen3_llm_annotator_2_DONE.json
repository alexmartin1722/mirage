        "prediction": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built, it is intended to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as the premier space observatory of the 2020s. The JWST project was initiated by NASA in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). After years of development and multiple delays, the telescope was successfully launched on December 25, 2021, from the ELA-3 launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.\n\nFollowing its launch, the JWST began a complex deployment sequence, which included unfolding its sunshield and primary mirror segments. This process, critical for the telescope's operation, was completed without major issues by January 8, 2022. The telescope then proceeded to its operational orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, where it arrived on January 24, 2022. The subsequent months were dedicated to cooling the instruments to their operational temperatures, aligning the mirror segments, and calibrating the scientific instruments. The JWST was officially declared operational and ready for science observations on July 12, 2022, marking the beginning of its mission to explore the early universe, study the atmospheres of exoplanets, and observe some of the most distant galaxies and objects in the cosmos.",

Despite the extensive damage, the main structure of the cathedral, including its two iconic bell towers, survived the inferno. The fire drew international attention and prompted a global outpouring of support for the restoration efforts, with numerous individuals and organizations pledging substantial donations toward the rebuilding process.",
