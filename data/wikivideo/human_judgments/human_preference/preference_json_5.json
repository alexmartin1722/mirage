    "Liberation_Day_Tariffs": {
        "reference": "The Liberation Day tariffs are a broad package of import duties announced by Donald Trump in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on April 2, 2025 \u2014a date he called 'Liberation Day.'  The Trump administration called the measures 'reciprocal' tariffs to mirror and counteract foreign trade barriers imposed on U.S. exports. The tariffs imposed a 10% baseline tariff and higher rates to countries which the United States had the largest trade deficits. With the tariffs, the Trump administration also closed the de minimis exemption for China.   \r\n\r\nThe announcement lead to a global market crash and was faced with criticism. Trade analysts rejected the Trump administrations characterization of tariffs as 'reciprocal,' noting that the tariffs often exceeded those imposed by trading partners and included countries with which the U.S. had a trade surplus. Economists also criticized the formula used to calculate the tariffs, calling it simplistic and based on flawed economic reasoning. \r\n\r\nThe executive order signed by Trump to implement these tariffs declared a national emergency over the United States' trade deficit and invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize sweeping tariffs on foreign imports. On May 28, 2025, the United States Court of International Trade ruled Trump had overstepped his authority in imposing tariffs under the IEEPA and ordered that the 'Liberation Day' tariffs be vacated. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a stay while it considered the administration's appeal, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect.",
        "first_prediction": "On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., announcing new tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, the European Union, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Switzerland, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The tariffs, ranging from 20% to 36%, were designed to address what the administration perceived as unfair trade practices and to encourage domestic manufacturing. Trump emphasized that the U.S. would not impose a full 100% reciprocal tariff, stating his intention to be \"kind to the world\" while protecting American industries. The announcement, made after the stock market closing bell, had already contributed to market volatility, with significant losses reported in the stock market, including a $3 trillion drop in value, referred to as a \"stock market armageddon.\" Financial analysts, such as those from JPMorgan Chase & Co., raised the recession risk forecast to 60%, up from 40% prior to the announcement. The legal and economic implications of these tariffs were widely discussed, with experts debating the constitutionality of the President's actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the potential long-term impacts on global trade dynamics and consumer prices.",

        "third_prediction": "Liberation Day Tariffs refer to a set of economic measures and tariffs that were implemented in several countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, following their liberation from Axis occupation during World War II. These tariffs were designed to help rebuild war-torn economies by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, generating revenue for reconstruction efforts, and stabilizing national currencies. The specific tariffs varied by country, reflecting each nation's unique economic conditions and strategic priorities. While initially seen as necessary for recovery, over time, these tariffs often led to trade disputes and were gradually phased out as international economic cooperation and organizations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) promoted global trade liberalization.",
